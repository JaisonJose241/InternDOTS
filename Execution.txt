Flow of execution:
1. 'circuits' word file explains how to do the wiring, I have used nodeMCU as its cheap and less power comnsuming device.
2. 'code_on_esp' is the code used to write on NodeMCU; written in Arduino.
3.  Account on thingsSpeak is made as to record data, since I don't have a server.
4.  Since, I am more familiar with HTML and JAVAScript I took it as to show map location based on thingSpeak API value.

Procedure in execution:
1.GPS module gives the location to ESP8266
2.ESP8266 sends the data to the thingspeak database to record values, using connected wifi network.
3.The index_page.html webpage shows the map by using google API and Thingspeak API to fetch and show values in an 
  interactive way on the map with latest recorded value.
